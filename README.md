# Sprint-3

# Overview

Our team wants to create a platform to store recipes for users.

The recipes will be stored in a database. There will be a GUI integrated with the option to view, edit, and delete recipes. In addition, there will be an option to half, double, or triple the recipe where units will be converted accordingly.

The purpose of this software is to allow users to access all of their favorite recipes in the same place and change the quantities when desired.

# Development Environment

We developed this recipe platform using Java and used MySQL to store the data

List of libraries included to the project:

- [java.util.List]
- [java.sql]
- [java.util.ArrayList]
- [java.util.Scanner]
- [javax.swing]
- [java.awt]

# Future Work

Currently nothing in our program is actually connected. The database, GUI, and conversion aspect function seperately, but are not integrated together.

- Display recipes from database on GUI
- Connect conversion function to ingredients displayed
